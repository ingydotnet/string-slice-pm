NAME
    String::Slice - Shared Memory Slices of Bigger Strings

SYNOPSIS
        use String::Slice;

        my $buffer = fetch_enormous_string;
        my $slice;

        # Make $slice reference chars 101-125 of $buffer
        slice($slice, $buffer, 101, 25);

        # Make $slice reference chars 126-175 of $buffer
        slice($slice, $buffer, 25, 50);

        # Make $slice reference chars 120 to end of $buffer
        slice($slice, $buffer, -6);

        # Look for $pattern in $buffer,
        # at each 100 byte starting point
        $slice = '';    # Reset $slice
        for (my $i = 0; slice($slice, $buffer, $i); $i += 100) {
            if ($slice =~ /^$pattern/) { ... do it ... }
        }

DESCRIPTION
    Processing large strings in Perl is inefficient because to access any
    smaller portion of a buffer you need to make a copy of that portion.

    This module lets you make a string scalar point to a portion of the
    content of another string scalar.

    The primary goal of this module is to make the parsing large data much
    faster in Perl.

API
    String::Slice exports one function: "slice". It can be called in a few
    different ways:

        slice($slice_variable, $big_buffer_variable, $char_offset, $char_length)

    This effectively makes $slice_variable a substr of the buffer. The
    offset defaults to 0, and if no length is given, the slice goes to the
    end of the buffer. One side effect of this function is that both strings
    will become readonly, and the memory will not be freed until they both
    go out of scope.

    If $slice is already a slice of $buffer then this call:

        slice($slice, $buffer, $offset, $length)

    will move the offset forward by the specified number (or backwards if
    the offset is negative).

    If length is too long, the slice will go to the end of the buffer.

    The "slice" function returns 1 on success and 0 on failure. Failure
    occurs if the requested offset is invalid (less than the start or
    greater than or equal to the end of the buffer).
